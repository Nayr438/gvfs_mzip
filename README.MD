GunZ MRS File Viewer.

Requires QT for the GUI Build. Originally built and tested for Linux but should also work in Windows.

It was in the middle of a rewrite and it hasn't been touched in awhile.
Not sure what works and what doesn't, MZipRecovery appears to longer be used but appears to have the old code, the code was intended to bruteforce extraction when RecoveryChar is used but unknown.
