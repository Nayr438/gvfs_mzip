Requires Meson to build.
Requires QT for the GUI Build, would have preferred to use something else but cross-platform toolkits kind of suck.

Originally built and tested for Linux but should also work in Windows.

It was in the middle of a rewrite and it hasn't been touched in awhile.
Not sure what works and what doesn't.

MZipRecovery attempts to bruteforce decompression of archives that utilize ConvertChar/RecoveryChar, it should automatically attempt this if the signature check fails while using the GUI build.

If some things seem redundant, it's because it was initially being designed as a library.

May come back to this in the future but for now it's unmaintained.

A demo from before the rewrite, but this one works similarly. If I find the old one I will upload it as well.
