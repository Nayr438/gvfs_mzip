GunZ MRS File Viewer.

Requires Meson to build.
Requires QT for the GUI Build, would have preferred to use something else but cross-platform toolkits kind of suck.

Originally built and tested for Linux but should also work in Windows.

It was in the middle of a rewrite and it hasn't been touched in awhile.
Not sure what works and what doesn't, MZipRecovery appears to no longer be used but appears to have the old code, the code was intended to bruteforce extraction when RecoveryChar is used but unknown.

May come back to this in the future but for now it's unmaintained.

A demo from before the rewrite
